# Track Job Applications

---------------------------
Web extension created with Vue and Vite, from
the [Web Extension Template](https://github.com/anthttps://github.com/antfu-collective/vitesse-webext)
by [antfu](https://github.com/antfu).

This extension works by opening a side panel in the browser, where job posting details can be filled out manually or
parsed from various websites with LLM models (including OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Ollama). \
It also allows users to
upload files related to job applications and
automatically sends the job postings and attached files to an external database (customizable).
The extension can automatically pick up files that are uploaded to a website (when the extension is active).
Uploaded files can be previewed in the extension.
